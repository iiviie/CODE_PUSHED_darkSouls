# Elden Code Pushed

A VS Code extension that displays an Elden Ring-style "GIT PUSHED" overlay with sound effect whenever you push code.

## How it works

When you push code via:
- VS Code's Git extension (using the Git push buttons/commands)
- Terminal (`git push`)

The extension displays a full-screen overlay with the iconic Elden Ring death screen style and plays the sound effect. The overlay automatically closes after 8 seconds, or you can dismiss it early by clicking anywhere or pressing any key.

## Installation

Available on the VS Code Marketplace: [Elden Code Pushed](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=iiviie.elden-code-pushed)

## Testing

Use the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`) and run `Elden Code Pushed: Test Overlay` to preview the effect.
